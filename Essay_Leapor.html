An Essay on Woman
Mary Leapor

<div id="line1" class="line">Woman, a pleasing but a short-lived flow'r,</div>
<div id="line2" class="line">Too soft for business and too weak for pow'r:</div>
<div id="line3" class="line">A wife in bondage, or neglected maid;</div>
<div id="line4" class="line">Despised, if ugly; if she's fair, betrayed.</div>
<div id="line5" class="line">'Tis wealth alone inspires ev'ry grace,</div>
<div id="line6" class="line">And calls the raptures to her plenteous face.</div>
<div id="line7" class="line">What numbers for those charming features pine,</div>
<div id="line8" class="line">If blooming acres round her temples twine!</div>
<div id="line9" class="line">Her lip the strawberry, and her eyes more bright</div>
<div id="line10" class="line">Than sparkling Venus in a frosty night;</div>
<div id="line11" class="line">Pale lilies fade and, when the fair appears,</div>
<div id="line12" class="line">Snow turns a negro and dissolves in tears,</div>
<div id="line13" class="line">And, where the charmer treads her magic toe,</div>
<div id="line14" class="line">On English ground Arabian odours grow;</div>
<div id="line15" class="line">Till mighty Hymen lifts his sceptred rod,</div>
<div id="line16" class="line">And sinks her glories with a fatal nod,</div>
<div id="line17" class="line">Dissolves her triumphs, sweeps her charms away,</div>
<div id="line18" class="line">And turns the goddess to her native clay.</div>
<div id="line19" class="line">But, Artemisia, let your servant sing</div>
<div id="line20" class="line">What small advantage wealth and beauties bring.</div>
<div id="line21" class="line">Who would be wise, that knew Pamphilia's fate?</div>
<div id="line22" class="line">Or who be fair, and joined to Sylvia's mate?</div>
<div id="line23" class="line">Sylvia, whose cheeks are fresh as early day,</div>
<div id="line24" class="line">As ev'ning mild, and sweet as spicy May:</div>
<div id="line25" class="line">And yet that face her partial husband tires,</div>
<div id="line26" class="line">And those bright eyes, that all the world admires.</div>
<div id="line27" class="line">Pamphilia's wit who does not strive to shun,</div>
<div id="line28" class="line">Like death's infection or a dog-day's sun?</div>
<div id="line29" class="line">The damsels view her with malignant eyes,</div>
<div id="line30" class="line">The men are vexed to find a nymph so wise:</div>
<div id="line31" class="line">And wisdom only serves to make her know</div>
<div id="line32" class="line">The keen sensation of superior woe.</div>
<div id="line33" class="line">The secret whisper and the list'ning ear,</div>
<div id="line34" class="line">The scornful eyebrow and the hated sneer,</div>
<div id="line35" class="line">The giddy censures of her babbling kind,</div>
<div id="line36" class="line">With thousand ills that grate a gentle mind,</div>
<div id="line37" class="line">By her are tasted in the first degree,</div>
<div id="line38" class="line">Though overlooked by Simplicus and me.</div>
<div id="line39" class="line">Does thirst of gold a virgin's heart inspire,</div>
<div id="line40" class="line">Instilled by nature or a careful sire?</div>
<div id="line41" class="line">Then let her quit extravagance and play,</div>
<div id="line42" class="line">The brisk companion and expensive tea,</div>
<div id="line43" class="line">To feast with Cordia in her filthy sty</div>
<div id="line44" class="line">On stewed potatoes or on mouldy pie;</div>
<div id="line45" class="line">Whose eager eyes stare ghastly at the poor,</div>
<div id="line46" class="line">And fright the beggars from her hated door;</div>
<div id="line47" class="line">In greasy clouts she wraps her smoky chin,</div>
<div id="line48" class="line">And holds that pride's a never-pardoned sin.</div>
<div id="line49" class="line">If this be wealth, no matter where it falls;</div>
<div id="line50" class="line">But save, ye Muses, save your Mira's walls:</div>
<div id="line51" class="line">Still give me pleasing indolence and ease,</div>
<div id="line52" class="line">A fire to warm me and a friend to please.</div>
<div id="line53" class="line">Since, whether sunk in avarice or pride,</div>
<div id="line54" class="line">A wanton virgin or a starving bride;</div>
<div id="line55" class="line">Or wond'ring crowds attend her charming tongue,</div>
<div id="line56" class="line">Or, deemed an idiot, ever speaks the wrong;</div>
<div id="line57" class="line">Though nature armed us for the growing ill</div>
<div id="line58" class="line">With fraudful cunning and a headstrong will;</div>
<div id="line59" class="line">Yet, with ten thousand follies to her charge,</div>
<div id="line60" class="line">Unhappy woman's but a slave at large.</div>
